# Atomic-Robokid
C64 Source Code to Atomic Robokid
(c)Michael J Archer

Source code to the C64 Conversion of Atomic Robokid.
This was a multi-loader with lots of levels. I dumped all my backup folders here, I think first time to use a sprite multi plexer.
From looking at source it handled up to 22 sprites. (badly sometimes!, but it works).
I made it quite dynamic how the sprites were handled. Totally forgotten this code as to how it hangs together.

Source used cross development called PDS on a PC to build, so it's not complete how you would go about making it assemble now, with complex multi-loader part
There is nice source code for a tape and disk loader as seperate files maybe some use to somebody. Looks like used somthing called kdos.
